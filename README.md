# KrushiMitra - NABARD Carbon Credits App

A cross-platform, open-source Flutter application that democratizes carbon credit access for Indiaâ€™s 146 million smallholder farmers by providing the first affordable, scalable MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) system tailored for fragmented agricultural landscapes.

## Brief Description

Current MRV systems are too expensive and complex for small farms, making carbon credits inaccessible. Our solution flips this model: farmers use a simple mobile app to collect data, while free satellite imagery and automated backend analysis provide continuous, low-cost verification. This reduces transaction costs by up to 80%, enabling even 1-acre farms to participate in carbon markets and earn new income streams.

## Technology Stack
- **Mobile:** Flutter/Dart (cross-platform)
- **Backend:** Python Flask, Google Earth Engine (satellite/NDVI processing)
- **Database:** Supabase (farmer profiles, boundaries)
- **Auth:** Firebase
- **Mapping:** OpenStreetMap, flutter_map
- **APIs:** RESTful, real-time NDVI and carbon calculations

## Prototype Overview
- **Farmers register and create a profile** (name, village, crop type)
- **Interactive farm boundary mapping** using tap-to-trace on satellite imagery
- **Evidence collection:** geotagged photos, voice notes, offline-first data capture
- **AI-powered validation:** combines satellite NDVI with farmer data, shows confidence scores (traffic-light indicators)
- **Automated carbon credit calculations** using IPCC-compliant methods and Indian emission factors
- **Quality assurance:** flags errors, supports human review with side-by-side satellite and field data
- **End-to-end workflow:** registration â†’ mapping â†’ data collection â†’ validation â†’ calculation â†’ reporting

## Key Features & Innovations
- **Complete MRV Pipeline:** Monitor, Calculate, Report tabs for full carbon workflow
- **Advanced Satellite Integration:** Real-time NDVI analysis, Google Earth Engine backend
- **Interactive Mapping:** Draw farm boundaries, search locations, save polygons to Supabase
- **Carbon Credit Engine:** IPCC Tier 1/2, crop/tree-based COâ‚‚e, Gold Standard references
- **Comprehensive Data Collection:** Photos, voice, quick field data, seasonal tracking
- **Farmer-Centric:** Data ownership, voice-first UI, offline support, no MRV fees for farmers
- **Open-Source & Scalable:** Designed for rapid scale-up, low cost, and broad accessibility

## Intended Users
Smallholder farmers across India practicing sustainable agriculture, agroforestry, or climate-smart farming, who are currently excluded from carbon markets due to high verification costs and technical barriers.

## What Makes This Unique?
- **Farmer-first:** Data ownership, direct benefits, no MRV fees
- **Open-source:** Uses free satellite data and open tools, not proprietary systems
- **Offline & Voice-first:** Designed for rural, low-literacy, low-connectivity environments
- **Platform-agnostic:** Can be used by any farmer, not tied to a supply chain or corporate program
- **Scalable:** Automated, low-cost, and ready for millions of users

## Impact & Scalability
- Enables 146 million Indian smallholder farmers to join carbon markets
- Reduces MRV costs by up to 80%
- Turns agriculture (18% of Indiaâ€™s emissions) into a carbon sink
- Provides new income for rural communities
- Scalable, open, and ready for rapid adoption

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart
- Android Studio or VS Code (recommended)
